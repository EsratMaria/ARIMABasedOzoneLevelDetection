# ARIMA Based Ozone Level Detection
An ARIMA based forecasting model to predict the level of Ozone in the air using **R**.

This project was done as the final submission for the course Time series Data Analysis. In this project I made an ARIMA model to forecast **Ozone level** in the air. 

The process has been done using ``R``

The details of this entire procedure has been included [here](/FinalProject.pdf).
